  # We would like to have a mypy pre-commit hook, but due to the fact that
  # pre-commit runs in it's own isolated environment, we would need to install
  # and keep in sync all dependencies so mypy has access to the appropriate type
  # stubs. This does not seem worth it at the moment, so for now we will stick to
  # having mypy run via Github Actions / manually by contributors
