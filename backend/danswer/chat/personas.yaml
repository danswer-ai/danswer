      Ask Questions or get Summaries from your documents
    # Default Prompt objects attached to the persona, see prompts.yaml
    prompts:
      - "Answer-Question"
      - "Summarize"
    # Default number of chunks to include as context, set to 0 to disable retrieval
    # Remove the field to set to the system default number of chunks/tokens to pass to Gen AI
    # If selecting documents, user can bypass this up until NUM_DOCUMENT_TOKENS_FED_TO_GENERATIVE_MODEL
    # Each chunk is 512 tokens long
    num_chunks: 5
    # Enable/Disable usage of the LLM chunk filter feature whereby each chunk is passed to the LLM to determine
    # if the chunk is useful or not towards the latest user query
    # This feature can be overriden for all personas via DISABLE_LLM_CHUNK_FILTER env variable
    llm_relevance_filter: true
    # Enable/Disable usage of the LLM to extract query time filters including source type and time range filters
    llm_filter_extraction: true
    # Decay documents priority as they age, options are:
    # - favor_recent (2x base by default, configurable)
    # - base_decay
    # - no_decay
    # - auto (model chooses between favor_recent and base_decay based on user query)
    recency_bias: "auto"
    # Default Document Sets for this persona, specified as a list of names here.
    # If the document set by the name exists, it will be attached to the persona
    # If the document set by the name does not exist, it will be created as an empty document set with no connectors
    # The admin can then use the UI to add new connectors to the document set
    # Example:
    # document_sets:
    #   - "HR Resources"
    #   - "Engineer Onboarding"
    #   - "Benefits"
    document_sets: []
    # Inject a statement at the end of system prompt to inform the LLM of the current date/time
    # Format looks like: "October 16, 2023 14:30"
