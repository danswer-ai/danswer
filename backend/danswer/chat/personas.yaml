# Currently in the UI, each Persona only has one prompt, which is why there are 3 very similar personas defined below.

personas:
  # This id field can be left blank for other default personas, however an id 0 persona must exist
  # this is for DanswerBot to use when tagged in a non-configured channel
  # Careful setting specific IDs, this won't autoincrement the next ID value for postgres
  - id: 0
    name: "Default"

    # Enable/Disable usage of the LLM chunk filter feature whereby each chunk is passed to the LLM to determine
    # if the chunk is useful or not towards the latest user query
    # This feature can be overriden for all personas via DISABLE_LLM_CHUNK_FILTER env variable

    # Decay documents priority as they age, options are:
    # - favor_recent (2x base by default, configurable)
    # - base_decay

    # Default Document Sets for this persona, specified as a list of names here.
    # If the document set by the name exists, it will be attached to the persona
    # If the document set by the name does not exist, it will be created as an empty document set with no connectors
    # The admin can then use the UI to add new connectors to the document set
    # Example:
    # document_sets:
    #   - "HR Resources"
    #   - "Engineer Onboarding"
    #   - "Benefits"
