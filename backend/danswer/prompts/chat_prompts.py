# Design considerations for the below:
# - In case of uncertainty, favor yes search so place the "yes" sections near the start of the
#   prompt and after the no section as well to deemphasize the no section
# - Conversation history can be a lot of tokens, make sure the bulk of the prompt is at the start
#   or end so the middle history section is relatively less paid attention to than the main task
# - Works worse with just a simple yes/no, seems asking it to produce "search" helps a bit, can
#   consider doing COT for this and keep it brief, but likely only small gains.

Given the following conversation and a follow-up input, generate Python code using matplotlib to create the requested graph.
IMPORTANT: The code should be complete and executable, including data generation if necessary.
Focus on creating a clear and informative visualization based on the user's request.

Guidelines:
- Import matplotlib.pyplot as plt at the beginning of the code.
- Generate sample data if specific data is not provided in the conversation.
- Use appropriate graph types (line, bar, scatter, pie) based on the nature of the data and request.
- Include proper labeling (title, x-axis, y-axis, legend) in the graph.
- Use plt.figure() to create the figure and assign it to a variable named 'fig'.
- Do not include plt.show() at the end of the code.
