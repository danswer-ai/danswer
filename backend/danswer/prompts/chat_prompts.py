# Design considerations for the below:
# - In case of uncertainty, favor yes search so place the "yes" sections near the start of the
#   prompt and after the no section as well to deemphasize the no section
# - Conversation history can be a lot of tokens, make sure the bulk of the prompt is at the start
#   or end so the middle history section is relatively less paid attention to than the main task
# - Works worse with just a simple yes/no, seems asking it to produce "search" helps a bit, can
#   consider doing COT for this and keep it brief, but likely only small gains.
