    # Default Document Sets for this assistant, specified as a list of names here.
    # If the document set by the name exists, it will be attached to the assistant
    # If the document set by the name does not exist, it will be created as an empty document set with no connectors
    # The admin can then use the UI to add new connectors to the document set

    # document_sets:
    #   - "HR Resources"
    #   - "Engineer Onboarding"
    #   - "Benefits"
