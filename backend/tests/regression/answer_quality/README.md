# Search Quality Test Script

This Python script automates the process of running search quality tests for a backend system.

## Features

- Loads configuration from a YAML file
- Sets up Docker environment
- Manages environment variables
- Switches to specified Git branch
- Uploads test documents
- Runs search quality tests using Relari
- Cleans up Docker containers (optional)

## Usage

1. Ensure you have the required dependencies installed.
2. Configure the `search_test_config.yaml` file based on the `search_test_config.yaml.template` file.
3. Configure the `.env_eval` file in `deployment/docker_compose` with the correct environment variables.
4. Navigate to Danswer repo:
```
cd path/to/danswer
```
5. Set Python Path variable:
```
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$PWD/backend
```
6. Navigate to the answer_quality folder:
```
cd backend/tests/regression/answer_quality
```
7. Run the script:
```
python run_eval_pipeline.py
```

Note: All data will be saved even after the containers are shut down. There are instructions below to re-launching docker containers using this data.

If you decide to run multiple UIs at the same time, the ports will increment upwards from 3000 (E.g. http://localhost:3001). 

To see which port the desired instance is on, look at the ports on the nginx container by running `docker ps` or using docker desktop.

Docker daemon must be running for this to work. 

## Configuration

Edit `search_test_config.yaml` to set:

- output_folder
    - This is the folder where the folders for each test will go 
    - These folders will contain the postgres/vespa data as well as the results for each test
- zipped_documents_file
    - The path to the zip file containing the files you'd like to test against
- questions_file
    - The path to the yaml containing the questions you'd like to test with 
- branch
    - Set the branch to null if you want it to just use the code as is
- clean_up_docker_containers
    - Set this to true to automatically delete all docker containers, networks and volumes after the test
- launch_web_ui
    - Set this to true if you want to use the UI during/after the testing process
- use_cloud_gpu
    - Set to true or false depending on if you want to use the remote gpu
    - Only need to set this if use_cloud_gpu is true
- model_server_ip
    - This is the ip of the remote model server
    - Only need to set this if use_cloud_gpu is true   
- model_server_port
    - This is the port of the remote model server
    - Only need to set this if use_cloud_gpu is true
- existing_test_suffix
    - Use this if you would like to relaunch a previous test instance
    - Input the suffix of the test you'd like to re-launch 
    - (E.g. to use the data from folder "test_1234_5678" put "_1234_5678")
    - No new files will automatically be uploaded
    - Leave empty to run a new test
- limit
    - Max number of questions you'd like to ask against the dataset
    - Set to null for no limit
- llm
    - Fill this out according to the normal LLM seeding


## Relaunching From Existing Data

To launch an existing set of containers that has already completed indexing, set the existing_test_suffix variable. This will launch the docker containers mounted on the volumes of the indicated suffix and will not automatically index any documents or run any QA.

Once these containers are launched you can run file_uploader.py or run_qa.py (assuming you have run the steps in the Usage section above). 
- file_uploader.py will upload and index additional zipped files located at the zipped_documents_file path. 
- run_qa.py will ask questions located at the questions_file path against the indexed documents.
