# Bitnami Common Library Chart

A [Helm Library Chart](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/library_charts/#helm) for grouping common logic between Bitnami charts.

## TL;DR

```yaml
dependencies:
  - name: common
    version: 2.x.x
    repository: oci://registry-1.docker.io/bitnamicharts
```

```console
helm dependency update
```

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: {{ include "common.names.fullname" . }}
data:
  myvalue: "Hello World"
```

## Introduction

This chart provides a common template helpers which can be used to develop new charts using [Helm](https://helm.sh) package manager.

Bitnami charts can be used with [Kubeapps](https://kubeapps.dev/) for deployment and management of Helm Charts in clusters.

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes 1.23+
- Helm 3.8.0+

## Parameters

## Special input schemas

### ImageRoot

```yaml
registry:
  type: string

  example: docker.io

repository:
  type: string
  description: Repository and image name
  example: bitnami/nginx

tag:
  type: string

debug:
  type: boolean
  description: Set to true if you would like to see extra information on logs
  example: false

## An instance would be:
# registry: docker.io
# repository: bitnami/nginx
# tag: 1.16.1-debian-10-r63
# pullPolicy: IfNotPresent
# debug: false
```

### Persistence

```yaml
enabled:
  type: boolean
  description: Whether enable persistence.
  example: true

storageClass:
  type: string
  description: Ghost data Persistent Volume Storage Class, If set to "-", storageClassName: "" which disables dynamic provisioning.
  example: "-"

accessMode:
  type: string
  description: Access mode for the Persistent Volume Storage.
  example: ReadWriteOnce

size:
  type: string
  description: Size the Persistent Volume Storage.
  example: 8Gi

path:
  type: string
  description: Path to be persisted.
  example: /bitnami

## An instance would be:
# enabled: true
# storageClass: "-"
# accessMode: ReadWriteOnce
# size: 8Gi
# path: /bitnami
```

### ExistingSecret

```yaml
name:
  type: string
  description: Name of the existing secret.
  example: mySecret
keyMapping:
  description: Mapping between the expected key name and the name of the key in the existing secret.
  type: object

## An instance would be:
# name: mySecret
# keyMapping:
#   password: myPasswordKey
```

#### Example of use

When we store sensitive data for a deployment in a secret, some times we want to give to users the possibility of using theirs existing secrets.

```yaml
# templates/secret.yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: {{ include "common.names.fullname" . }}
  labels:
    app: {{ include "common.names.fullname" . }}
type: Opaque
data:
  password: {{ .Values.password | b64enc | quote }}

# templates/dpl.yaml
---
...
      env:
        - name: PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: {{ include "common.secrets.name" (dict "existingSecret" .Values.existingSecret "context" $) }}
              key: {{ include "common.secrets.key" (dict "existingSecret" .Values.existingSecret "key" "password") }}
...

# values.yaml
---
name: mySecret
keyMapping:
  password: myPasswordKey
```

### ValidateValue

#### NOTES.txt

```console
{{- $validateValueConf00 := (dict "valueKey" "path.to.value00" "secret" "secretName" "field" "password-00") -}}
{{- $validateValueConf01 := (dict "valueKey" "path.to.value01" "secret" "secretName" "field" "password-01") -}}

{{ include "common.validations.values.multiple.empty" (dict "required" (list $validateValueConf00 $validateValueConf01) "context" $) }}
```

If we force those values to be empty we will see some alerts

```console
helm install test mychart --set path.to.value00="",path.to.value01=""
    'path.to.value00' must not be empty, please add '--set path.to.value00=$PASSWORD_00' to the command. To get the current value:

        export PASSWORD_00=$(kubectl get secret --namespace default secretName -o jsonpath="{.data.password-00}" | base64 -d)

    'path.to.value01' must not be empty, please add '--set path.to.value01=$PASSWORD_01' to the command. To get the current value:

        export PASSWORD_01=$(kubectl get secret --namespace default secretName -o jsonpath="{.data.password-01}" | base64 -d)
```

## Upgrading

### To 1.0.0

[On November 13, 2020, Helm v2 support was formally finished](https://github.com/helm/charts#status-of-the-project), this major version is the result of the required changes applied to the Helm Chart to be able to incorporate the different features added in Helm v3 and to be consistent with the Helm project itself regarding the Helm v2 EOL.

#### What changes were introduced in this major version?

- Previous versions of this Helm Chart use `apiVersion: v1` (installable by both Helm 2 and 3), this Helm Chart was updated to `apiVersion: v2` (installable by Helm 3 only). [Here](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/charts/#the-apiversion-field) you can find more information about the `apiVersion` field.
- Use `type: library`. [Here](https://v3.helm.sh/docs/faq/#library-chart-support) you can find more information.
- The different fields present in the *Chart.yaml* file has been ordered alphabetically in a homogeneous way for all the Bitnami Helm Charts

#### Considerations when upgrading to this version

- If you want to upgrade to this version from a previous one installed with Helm v3, you shouldn't face any issues
- If you want to upgrade to this version using Helm v2, this scenario is not supported as this version doesn't support Helm v2 anymore
- If you installed the previous version with Helm v2 and wants to upgrade to this version with Helm v3, please refer to the [official Helm documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/v2_v3_migration/#migration-use-cases) about migrating from Helm v2 to v3
